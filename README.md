# Scada2IOTADLT
Scada Canbus/TCP gateway to IOTA Tangle Distributed Ledger Interface 
Added UML Overview Diagram explaining Enersettle Concept 
Settled on Rust as the dev language for integration oracles into APIs for IOTA  and to connect to SAFENetwork and IPFS Storage networks
QUPLA Script  Driven SCs  operating on QNode Test Network  to be tested and validated in handling of monitoring and control plane generated logging info for posting to IOTA TANGLE from  an EnerSettle oracle attached QNode Gateway
The iotaledger/bee which consolidates and ports IOTA's current reference platforms for IOTA and QUBIC will be the baseline platform , which itself  attached to the IoT controllers (Raspberry Pi or similar) managing the Battery controller and direction to ground/heat sink  behaviour of the electrical power output, where behaviour is primarily driven by input signalling from wind speed, temperature and drive speed sensors mounted on the TWIND Power electrical generator feeding the batteries, and for secondary and excpetion operational use cases the same behaviour is fetched from oracle mounted rule sets governing such behaviour  and or fetchec from a human machine interface HMI piloted by the DER Distributed Energy Resource Manager
